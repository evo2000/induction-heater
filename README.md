## Junior Electrical Engineering Projects II

### ECE 394

Principles learned in ECE 393 are applied to the design, construction and characterization of electrical and computer engineering projects of significant complexity. Assignments typically involve both analog and digital design, and students are free to pursue any solution that satisfies the engineering requirements and meets with the instructor's approval. Formal and informal lectures are given on safety, circuit operation and design, and construction techniques; participation in design reviews and technical reports.
